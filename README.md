# API build in PHP

This was a solo project where I build this RESTful API in PHP using MVC but without the view. I used Postman to test it. </br>
The results are returned in JSON and I also add CRUD operations and validation mostly for the create part. </br>
For the database i used MySQL with a PDO connection. </br>
I also used Bramus router and endpoints for each methods. </br>

## Using requirements

If you want to use my API you will have to install both composer and Bramus router. </br>
This project runs locally with Apache. </br>
You will also have to create your own database.
